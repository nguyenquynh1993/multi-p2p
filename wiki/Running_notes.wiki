=NICE streaming application test=
Requirements:
•	 OMNeT++ 4.0p1 (source + IDE, tgz) 
•	OverSim-2009: svn/trunk/OverSim
•	INET-2009: svn/trunk/INET
Installation:
•	Download & untar OverSim-20090908.tgz & INET-OverSim-20090317.tgz
•	Copy and replace SVN code into extracted folders
•	Build in Omnetpp IDE
Configuration file: omnetpp.ini 
•	Modify **.hoang_use_cost=true (or false) to run with (or without) new cost function
•	To customize the cost function's variables (delay only, bandwidth only, delay+bandwidth) take a look at Nice::cost() in OverSim-20090908/src/overlay/Nice/Nice.cc
•	**.overlayTerminalNumber = 16, 32, 64 … 1024
Run:
	cd OverSim20090908/simulations
	../src/OverSim -u Cmdenv -c NiceTestAppGTITM


=Tests with an outside wimax singleHost=
Requirements:
OpenVPN
 OMNeT++ 4.1 (source + IDE, tgz)
MUST setup OverSim on two sides: Server and SingleHost (on two different hosts)
Installation:
Server: checkout svn/trunk/OverSim_server_2010 and svn/trunk/inet2010 in the omnetpp4.1 IDE.
SingleHost: checkout svn/trunk/OverSim_singlehost_2010 and  svn/trunk/inet2010
Configuration files:
Server: OverSim/simulations/realworld/world.ini
SingleHost: OverSim/simulations/realworld/niceapp.ini
Run:
 Setup OpenVPN tunnel between Server and SingleHost:
	Server: sudo openvpn openvpn_server.txt
	SingleHost:
		sudo openvpn openvpn_client.txt
		sudo ./add_static_route_singlehost.sh
Run at SingleHost first:
	cd OverSim/simulations/realworld/
	./run.sh
Then start Server:
	cd OverSim/simulations/realworld/
	sudo ./root_setup-world.sh
Notes:
Must setup openvpn tunnel afirst of all to create an interface 1.1.1.2 for SingleHost and to resolve the problem of public/private IP address range.
