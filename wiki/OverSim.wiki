#summary OverSim Overview

= Introduction =

Before oversim, there have been quite number of network simulators such as P2PSim, OverlayWeaver and PlanetSim. However, none of those become standard emulators / simulators for network researching community due to shortage of vital features:

P2PSim: no real-world interoperability, no visualization
OverlayWeaver: no real-world interconnection, unscalable
PlanetSim: too simplistic underlay network

Therefore, the researching community needs another tool to simulate their ideas: OverSim.

= Details =

== Modular Architectures ==

Separated modules can be developed by OMNeT++ 

== Layer Architectures ==

Underlying network 
Overlay network
Application layer

== Consistent interfaces between layers ==

Between layers, there are common APIs; therefore, changes in one interfaces do not interfere with other interfaces operation.

== Other features and characteristics ( Continue Updating ) ==
