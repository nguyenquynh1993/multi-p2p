#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

This wiki page is the note for difficulties and achievements in running a sample OverSim simulation.

In this sample project, the PING program is simulated. 

A node will send a message to an arbitrary node. Then it waits for a number of seconds before sending another message. 

A receiving node will reply the ping message through UDP and overlay networks.

The simulation is continued until the simulation is ended.

= Details =

The OverSimDevelop page gives detailed instructions about how to create a simple sample project. However, the given source code on this website has been simplified and some pre-processing code lines such as include, import, etc have not been provided. It causes problems during compilation for newbie. However, users can download the sample codes
