Problems:

*//Done*
1. IP address ranges -> OK
Simulate Network: 10.0.0.0/8
Real Single Host: get the IP of the network interface (eth0, wlan0) to join overlay
 - public: 157.159.16.186 
 - private in LAN: 192.168.1.10 -> tunnel OpenVPN
NOTE: must "add route" to get host known how to go to 10.0.0.0/8

2. Ports:
--> firewall policy: wimax BS 12356 UDP opened for OpenVPN -> OK

3. Global Statistic Object at different Oversim instances on different hosts
-> Stand at host to statistic, export to file -> OK

4. Rendez-vous Point (RP) in NICE. -> OK
Server: add a new NICE msg NICE_RP_NOTIFY to inform SingleHost immediately when RP changed
SingleHost: update RP by receiving NICE_RP_NOTIFY from server

5. Loop video sending to assure that all nodes send/receive each other -> OK
Finish time : manually after all node sent done

6. Bug fixed: Message received from external host has senderID = 0 ? (should be 1111) => remember to set isSender = true;	


*//WiP*

1. Physical hop-count -> 0.25 day
get TTL real Router + TTL Inet ? -> received ttl < 0 ? 

2. End-to-end Delay-> 0.5 day
Time stamp? now() - msg->getSentTime()
Clock Synchonizing on 2 hosts ? -> by PING PONG at initTime  

3. Summary all statistic files follow formulas -> 0.5 day

4. Get bandwidth, delay of real link
-> 3rdParty tool ? -> 0.25 day
