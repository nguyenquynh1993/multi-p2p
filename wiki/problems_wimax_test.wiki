Problems:

*//Done*
1. IP address ranges -> OK
Simulate Network: 10.0.0.0/8
Real Single Host: get the IP of the network interface (eth0, wlan0) to join overlay
 - public: 157.159.16.186 
 - private in LAN: 192.168.1.10 -> tunnel OpenVPN
NOTE: must "add route" to get host known how to go to 10.0.0.0/8

2. Ports:
--> firewall policy: wimax BS 12356 UDP opened for OpenVPN -> OK

3. Global Statistic Object at different Oversim instances on different hosts
-> Stand at host to statistic, export to file -> OK

4. Rendez-vous Point (RP) in NICE.
Server: add a new NICE msg NICE_RP_NOTIFY to inform SingleHost immediately when RP changed
SingleHost: update RP by receiving NICE_RP_NOTIFY from server
