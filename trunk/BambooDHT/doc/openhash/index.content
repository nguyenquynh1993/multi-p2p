<p>
OpenDHT is a publicly accessible distributed hash table (DHT)
<em>service</em>.  In contrast to the usual DHT model, clients of OpenDHT do
not need to run a DHT node in order to use the service.  Instead, they can
issue <em>put</em> and <em>get</em> operations to any DHT node, which
processes the operations on their behalf.  No credentials or accounts are
required to use the service, and the available storage is fairly shared across
all active clients.

<p>
This <em>service model</em> of DHT usage greatly simplifies deploying 
client applications.  By using OpenDHT as a highly-available naming and
storage service, clients can ignore the complexities of deploying and
maintaining a DHT and instead concentrate on developing more sophisticated
distributed applications.

<p>
OpenDHT's simple put-get interface is accessible over both Sun RPC and XML
RPC.  As such, the service is easy to access from virtually every programming
language and from behind almost all NATs and firewalls.

Financial support for the project has come from Intel (Karp, Ratnasamy, Rhea),
the National Science Foundation (Godfrey, Shenker, Stoica), and IBM (Rhea).
