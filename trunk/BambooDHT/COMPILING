To compile, make sure javac version 1.5 or later is in your path, or set
JAVAHOME, and then make.  If Java 1.5 is not yet available for your platform,
download the "Prototype for JSR014: Adding Generics to the Java[tm]
Programming Language v.  2.4" from 

  http://java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/adding_generics/

Then add the files

  adding_generics-2_4ea/collect.jar and
  adding_generics-2_4ea/gjc-rt.jar 
  
to bamboo/lib.  Make sure javac version 1.4 or later is in your path, and then
make.
