Problems:

1. IP address ranges
Simulate Network: 10.0.0.0/8
Real Single Host: get the IP of the network interface (eth0, wlan0) to join overlay
 - public: 157.159.16.186 
 - private in LAN: 192.168.1.10 -> tunnel OpenVPN
NOTE: must "add route" to get host known how to go to 10.0.0.0/8

2. Rendez-vous Point (RP) in NICE
Check if RP undefined then become RP => pre-defined RP for all nodes
original code: use static variable -> common for all NICE instances in one Oversim process on one computer

RP can be changed during the NICE process
--> SingleClient: 
	- join after simulate network ready
	- how to know RP: manual || read file on remote host -> XML exported by PHP

3. Get bandwidth, delay of real link
-> 3rdParty tool

4. Global Statistic Object at different Oversim instances on different hosts
-> Stand at host to statistic, export to files
-> Synthesize all statistic files

5. Physical hop-count + delay
get TTL real Router + TTL Inet ?
ping once to get TTL, delay of the path from real host to server

6. End-to-end Delay
Time stamp? Clock Synchonizing on 2 hosts ?
