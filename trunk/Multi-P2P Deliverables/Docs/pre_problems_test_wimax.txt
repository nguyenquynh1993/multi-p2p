Problems:

1. IP address ranges
Simulate Network: 10.0.0.0/8
Real Single Host: get the IP of the network interface (eth0, wlan0) to join overlay
 - public: 157.159.16.186 
 - private in LAN: 192.168.1.10 -> tunnel OpenVPN
NOTE: must "add route" to get host known how to go to 10.0.0.0/8

2. Rendez-vous Point (RP) in NICE
Check if RP undefined then become RP => pre-defined RP for all nodes
original code: use static variable -> common for all NICE instances in one Oversim process on one computer
or RPC

3. Ports:
- UDP port 1024 for Overlay service:  UDP:1024 packets will be forwarded into the TUN interface for Overlay Service
- Overlay-App port 2000
--> must distinguish
--> firewall policy

4. Get bandwidth, delay of real link
-> 3rdParty tool

5. Global Statistic Object at different Oversim instances on different hosts
-> Stand at host to statistic, export to file
-> Summary all statistic files

6. Physical hop-count
get TTL real Router + TTL Inet ?
ping once to get TTL from real host to server

7. End-to-end Delay
Time stamp? Clock Synchonizing on 2 hosts ? 

8. Remote Processing Call (RPC) -> exchange Info between hosts at different processes  
mechanism, tools, APIs ???
support Oversim ???
exchange which info ? RP

9. Distributed Resource sharing |+| Centralized Data statistic
Hard disk, memory, database server
-> mechanism ? tools ?
-> firewall
