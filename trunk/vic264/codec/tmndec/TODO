		          TODO version 3.1
		     ===========================

		       Suggestions are welcome.

1.0  (Annex O) Rate control cannot be used with temporal scalability (True-B
pictures).  Currently the number of frames between successive P pictures and
between successive B-pictures must be constant.

2.0  (Annex O) The reconstructed sequence (out.raw) at the encoder
must be written in display order.  Currently, the frames are written in
encoding order.

3.0  (Annex I) Intra Mode selection is based on TMN-8 rev.0 and will
not yield optimal compression.  

4.0  (Annex K) not yet implemented.

5.0  (Annex L) not yet implemented.

6.0  (Annex N) not yet implemented.

7.0  (Annex P) not yet implemented.

8.0  (Annex Q) not yet implemented.

9.0  (Annex R) not yet implemented.

10.0  Rounding Type supported at the decoder but not implemented at the
encoder.

Contributions are also welcomed.
