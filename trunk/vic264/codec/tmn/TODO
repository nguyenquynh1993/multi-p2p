		          TODO version 3.1
		     ===========================

		       Suggestions are welcome.

1.  (Annex I) Intra Mode selection is based on TMN-8 rev.0 and will
not yield optimal compression.  

2.  (Annex K) not yet implemented.

3.  (Annex L) not yet implemented.

4.  (Annex N) not yet implemented.

5.  (Annex O) Rate control cannot be used with scalability.

6.  (Annex O) The reconstructed sequence (out.raw) at the encoder
must be written in display order.  Currently, the frames are written in
encoding order.

7.  (Annex P) not yet implemented.

8.  (Annex Q) not yet implemented.

9.  (Annex R) not yet implemented.

10.  Rounding Type supported at the decoder but not implemented at the
